<h2>A Little About Myself</h2>

<div>

  <img src="./Darlene Duyn_files/duds.jpeg" alt="Picture of Dudley" class="img">

  <p>I was in the dental field for 21 years    and felt I was at a plateau.
      I have wanted to go into tech for many years. Actually, 21 years ago I had to make the decision between dental school and tech. I chose dental, to be honest, I wish I hadn't, though, I have learned a lot from those experiences. Yet finally got myself to a point where I actually could go back to school, so here I am! I'm <strong>excited</strong> to learn coding and see what kind of avenues it will open up for me, as well as achieving my future goals. In case you are wondering what they are ...</p>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h3>Future Goals</h3>
      <p><em>*This is in no particular order*</em></p> 

    <ul>
      <li>Move my mother back to Portand</li>
      <li>Buy a house where she has her own living space</li>
      <li>Travel with my fiancé and family
      </li>
      <li>Help him achieve his goal (like how is helping me with mine) as a certified pilot</li>
      <li>Have a dog rescue and name it after my dog, Dudley. I think "Dudley's do right animal rescue,"would be cute.</li>
      <li>Land a job where I can help create and design thee best efficient dental software program for general and specialized dental offices (I already have ideas)</li>
    </ul>
    </div>

      <div>
    <p>However, I know with these goals in mind, it's going to take a lot of hard work, determination, and patience.</p>
