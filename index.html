  <p>In case you are wondering why I decided   to go into tech, I was in the dental field for 21 years and felt I was at a plateau.
      I also have wanted to go into tech for many years and finally got to a point where I actually could go back to school. I'm excited to learn and achieve my future goals.</p>
